        <h1>Cloud ServerEg</h1>
        <h3>Steps required</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sign into AWS account using SSH on your terminal and the pem key</li>
                <li>In the terminal run the command git clone https://github.com/tejaswigowda/AME394Fall2019.git</li>
                <li>From there use the command line cd AME394Fall2019/cloudServerEg</li>
                <li>Run the node server utilizing node server.js</li>
                <li>Once the server is running your can go back to your computer and out of the AWS Ubuntu machine and 
                    run the upload the arudino code to connect to the AWS Server</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Server Code</h3>
        <p>The Node JS server has 3 courses '/' , '/getValue', and 'setValue ' and uses express, bodyparser, errorhandler and methodoverride 

it complete the usefulness. The '/' course send the client to the index.html record to fill the contributions on that document. 

the '/setValue' course disentangles the solicitation inquiry of both info esteems and sets the decoded qualities to VALUE1 and VALUE2 and afterward sends those 

two factors as strings in the server. at last the '/getValue' sends the VALUE1 and VALUE2 factors over the server and 

will be utilized for the watch to GET access to those factors.
        </p>
        <h3>Watch Code</h3>
        <p>The watchCode.ino interfaces with the AWS web server at the course/getValue and sets the http strategy to variable called httpcode 

. From that point it checks on the off chance that there is a httpcode getter than zero and, at that point sets the payload to the http toString. 

From that point the watch code prints out the httpcode and the payload (the worth). on the off chance that the http under zero, at that point print that there 

is a mistake
        </p>
        <h3>Public</h3>
        <p>The public directory holds two files one asyncjs and index.html. asyncjs is a file that will give the 
            html file asynchronous javascript functionality. The index.html is the front end for the webserver. It cotains
            two input forms and a submit button. The Submit button calls the function SendDataToServer which calls the 
            route /setValue and uses the two input forms to fill v1 and v2  of the setValue route and then doing a callback for the data.
            from there it does a loadfile for the url and cb.

        <h2>Port Map</h2>
        <p>The portMap.sh redirects to port 80</p>
